Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment. It
executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. For more information on using
Node.js, see the [Node.js Website][].

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

**This project is bound by a [Code of Conduct][].**

## Support

[instructions for getting support](.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Release Types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v10.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v10.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
* **LTS**: Releases that receive Long-term Support, with a focus on stability
  and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
  LTS releases receive 12 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 18 months
  of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered codenames,
  beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
  except in some special circumstances.
* **Nightly**: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
  changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). A
member of the Release Team [signs](#release-keys) each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
[Release README](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#readme).

### Download

Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.

#### Current and LTS Releases
<https://nodejs.org/download/release/>

The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-_codename_ directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
[latest-carbon](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-carbon/) directory
contains the latest Carbon (Node.js 8) release.

#### Nightly Releases
<https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/>

Each directory name and filename contains a date (in UTC time) and the commit
SHA at the HEAD of the release.

#### API Documentation

Documentation for the latest Current release is at <https://nodejs.org/api/>.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
_docs_ subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
<https://nodejs.org/download/docs/>.

### Verifying Binaries

Download directories contain a `SHASUMS256.txt` file with SHA checksums for the
files.

To download `SHASUMS256.txt` using `curl`:

```console
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt
```

To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run
it through `sha256sum` with a command such as:

```console
$ grep node-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -
```

For Current and LTS, the GPG detached signature of `SHASUMS256.txt` is in
`SHASUMS256.txt.sig`. You can use it with `gpg` to verify the integrity of
`SHASUM256.txt`. You will first need to import
[the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases](#release-keys). To
import the keys:

```console
$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D
```

See the bottom of this README for a full script to import active release keys.

Next, download the `SHASUMS256.txt.sig` for the release:

```console
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt.sig
```

Then use `gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.sig SHASUMS256.txt` to verify
the file's signature.
